In this tutorial we going to setup and configure NexentaEdge iSCSI compatible service.

NexentaEdge Extended S3 API with High-Performance iSCSI provides unique benefits which can be useful for Machine Deep Learning, Big Data and IoT frameworks:

* Access S3 objects as iSCSI LUNs
* Mount S3 objects for fast File/POSIX access avoid unnecessary copy, fetch only needed datasets
* Extended S3 feature set: Append, Range Writes, Object/Bucket snapshots, Key-Value Object access
* Data Reduction with global inline de-duplication, compression and erasure encoding
* Cost Reduction File/Block/DB access with S3 economics 

Use cases details:

* High-Performance iSCSI service with High-Availability built-in
* Advanced Versioned S3 Object Append and RW "Object as File" access
* S3 Object as a Key-Value database, including integrations w/ Caffe, TensorFlow, Spark, Kafka, etc
* High-performance Versioned S3 Object Stream Session (RW), including FUSE library to mount an object
* Management API for Snapshots and Clones, including Bucket instantaneous snapshots
* Transparent iSCSI to/from S3 bucket access

OPTIONAL: Prior to installation please ensure that you have ACTIVATION_KEY token available. If not yet register DevOps account, obtain license key here: https://community.nexenta.com/s/devops-edition
